This project started as an experiment in training and using generative models to construct a fictional jungle. At first, I was mostly focused on making it work. Loading datasets, running training loops, and so on. Generally, it felt technical and overwhelming. There was definitely a rough learning curve.

One of the biggest things I learned was how much the dataset affects everything. Changing the dataset changes the personality of the generated creatures. Some datasets produced somewhat more coherent forms, while most datas resulted in fragmented or abstract outputs. Training a diffusion model takes time, not just computational time, but mental time. Adjusting resolution, number of epochs, and batch size required patience. 

Sometimes the outputs looked muddy or repetitive, and I had to rethink preprocessing and training length. Watching noise gradually turn into an image is still fascinating to me. It feels mechanical, yet strangely organic.

The audio generation process was surprisingly captivating. Using a pretrained diffusion audio model allowed me to generate imagined jungle sounds quickly. However, I felt I had less direct control over the results compared to images. With images, I could visually trace how training adjustments affected output. With audio, it felt more like guiding probabilities than shaping structure. It was interesting, but also slightly unpredictable.

Generating the fictional animal language using a transformer model felt different again. This part was less about training and more about structuring prompts carefully. I realized that constraints in prompts produce more coherent invented systems.

Overall, this project made me more interested in training my own models for future work. The process is slow and sometimes frustrating, but it changes how I think about authorship, control, and experimentation.
